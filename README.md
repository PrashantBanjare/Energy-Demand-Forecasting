# Energy Demand Forecasting using ARIMA

- This project involves forecasting energy demand using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) statistical model. The model is trained on historical time series data to predict future electricity demand and help optimize energy resource planning.

## Key Features:

- Data Preprocessing: Converted datetime formats, handled missing values, and split data into training and test sets.
- Modeling: Applied ARIMA(5,1,0) to capture trends and temporal dependencies in energy demand data.
- Forecasting: Generated short-term demand forecasts and evaluated them against test data.
- Evaluation: Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for model performance assessment and visualized actual vs predicted trends.

## Importance:
- Accurate energy demand forecasting is essential for:
1. Ensuring optimal energy generation and load balancing
2. Reducing operational costs and improving efficiency
3. Supporting smart grid systems and sustainable energy usage
